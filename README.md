# Bookstore-database-app
Python program for a bookstore clerk to manage an inventory of books stored in a database. The program allows the clerk to perform tasks such as adding new books, updating book details, deleting books, and searching the database for specific titles. The database, named "ebookstore", contains a table called book, which stores information including the book ID, title, author, and quantity. The table is initially populated with several book entries. A menu-driven interface allows the clerk to easily select the desired function (e.g., enter, update, delete, or search for books) and interact with the database accordingly. The program demonstrates database management concepts covered in my HyperionDev coursework.
